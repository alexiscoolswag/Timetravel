    <h1>How fast do you need to go.</h1>
    <p> To make time slower you gotta go 182,262 miles per second (299,792 kilometers per second) in a vacuum </p>
    <p>So, simply going faster than light does not inherently lead to backwards time travel. Very specific conditions must be met and, of course, the speed of light remains the maximum speed of anything with mass.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Einstein, we know that the faster you go, the slower time passes so a very fast spaceship is a time machine to the future. Five years on a ship traveling at 99 percent the speed of light (2.5 years out and 2.5 years back) corresponds to roughly 36 years on Earth.</p>
    <p>if you're traveling at nearly the speed of light, the clock inside your rocket would show it takes less time to travel to your destination as it would on Earth. But, since the clocks at home would be moving at a standard rate you'd return home to everyone else being quite a bit older.</p>
    <P>To be honest in my opinion i belivie that TIMETRAVEL exist, you just need to be fast enough.</P>
